## Personal Statement
I am an engineering and science enthusiast committed to agility, responsibility, and teamwork. I strive to become an influential researcher in my field by consistently challenging myself and achieving my goals. My hobbies include liberal arts and languages, which I pursue passionately in my free time.

I bring a robust understanding of Semiconductor Devices, Optical Metrology, Computer Vision, and Data Science from my extensive experience in both professional environments and academic settings. My keen eye for detail, diligent work ethic, and strong project management skills make me a prime candidate for roles in Semiconductor Design and Manufacturing, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning Operations.

  * Project: Indoor Air Quality Sensor Fusion. The project, which was a collaborative between Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (Finland) and Osnabrück Hochschule (Germany), focused on developing an indoor air quality monitoring system. The system was designed to detect air quality, transmit and display the data to users via a custom mobile application, and trigger integrated warnings when measurements exceeded predefined thresholds.

## Work Experience
* **Intel Corp. (VNAT)**, (04/2021 - 12/2022). Saigon Hi-Tech Park, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
  * Title: Process and Equipment Engineer & Deep Learning Scientist.
  * Responsibilities:
    * Led multiple in-house projects at VNAT focused on integrating deep learning technology for product inspection in downstream operations. Successfully completed in December 2022, these projects not only received recognition in Intel's Q4 2022 internal audit for their impactful contributions but also were featured in Intel 2023 AI Everywhere Conference.
    * Curated tutorials and lead knowledge-sharing sessions on computer vision concepts for the Image Analytics Center of Excellence at Intel Ireland.
    * Mentored Python programming and machine learning techniques within Intel’s AI Everywhere Community, an initiative aimed at democratizing AI knowledge across the corporation.
    * Managed communications and coordinated events for NextGen Vietnam, a regional subsidiary of Intel's NextGen Initiative focusing on integrating and developing employee competencies.
  * Projects:
    * Intelligent Inspection and Automatic Disposition System: This project focused on developing a decentralized intelligent inspection system for material handling processes in downstream operations. Preliminary results validated the system’s feasibility, drawing significant interest from multiple management levels at Intel Vietnam. Additionally, the project was showcased at the Intel 2023 AI Everywhere Conference as a leading example of AI innovation within Intel.
    * Applied Deep Learning on Inspection in Reel Packaging: The project involved developing an automated inspection program capable of detecting packaging issues, such as out-of-pocket occurrences, and promptly alerting technicians or operators to take corrective action during the reel packaging process. The project was successfully completed and formally documented as a process of record.
