## Personal Statement
I am an engineering and science enthusiast committed to agility, responsibility, and teamwork. I strive to become an influential researcher in my field by consistently challenging myself and achieving my goals. My hobbies include liberal arts and languages, which I pursue passionately in my free time.

I bring a robust understanding of Semiconductor Devices, Optical Metrology, Computer Vision, and Data Science from my extensive experience in both professional environments and academic settings. My keen eye for detail, diligent work ethic, and strong project management skills make me a prime candidate for roles in Semiconductor Design and Manufacturing, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning Operations.
